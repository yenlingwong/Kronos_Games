# Kronos_Games

Kronos Games is a group project for the course Databases and Web Services at Jacobs University Bremen. I teamed up along with 3 other coursemates to create a gaming Website titled Kronos Games using PHP scripts and SQL queries. The project is implemented in sprints and each week there is a new task that requires us to make updates to the website. The structure of our database can be found in DBWS-updated.php in the repository.
