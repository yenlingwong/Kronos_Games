# Kronos_Games

This is my submission for the Databases and Web Services project component, which simulates a gaming website that allows administrators to insert records into the database for various entities,  and users to read those records
The front-end design is programmed using HTML & CSS and Javascript, whereas the back-end is programmed using PHP and SQL, to simulate a gaming website, with security measures to prevent SQL injections, autocomplete features and user authentication.
Additional Python scripts were also programmed to analyze user traffic with access and error logs, and also to display the location and IP address of the current user with an API.
Final Grade: 95%
